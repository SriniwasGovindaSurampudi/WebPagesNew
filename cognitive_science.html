				<td>Network diffusion accurately models the relationship between structural and functional brain connectivity networks</td>
				<td>This paper hypothesises that diffusion of signals on structural connection of the brain network can predict functinoal connectivity. Considering only one ROI actice at a time, the activation signals reaching its neighbor ROIs, through diffusion, at any given time is hypothesised as the pairwise correlation between these ROIs. These individually and independently active ROI activation diffusions are stacked together and hypothesised that the overall functional correlaton matrix can match at a particular scale.</td>

To demonstrate the site’s functionality, whole brain functional and structural connectivity matrices are derived from 60 subjects’ (ages 26–45) resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and dwMRI data and uploaded to the site. Graph theoretical properties can be applied on the connectivity matrices to infer about global and local properties. Functional connectivity matrices are derived from resting state fMRI, dwMRI, and structural connectivity matrices are derived from DTI, MRI methods.</td>

				<td>Can structure predict function in the human brain?</td>
				<td>This is a review paper that collectively comments on the effort of relating structural and functional connectivity data at multiple scales, i.e. micro and macro scale computational models. It also reviews on the practicality, assumptions ad scope of the present models. Importantly, relationship is robust for FC calculated in low frequencies(rs-fMRI) and longer sampling periods(minutes). Modeling this relationship is particularly useful as it is an indirect link towards cognitive processes.</td>

				<td>An automated labeling system for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on MRI scans into gyral based regions of interest</td>
				<td>This paper parcellates human cerebral cortex on magetic resonence images (MRI) into gyral based 68 region of interests (ROIs). Each hemisphere has 34 ROIs. They use a training set of 40 MRI scans and automatically label regions with an with an average interclass corelation of 0.835 across all of the ROIs. The data we use is parcellated using this method.</td>

				<td>Structural Architecture Supports Functional Organization in the Human Aging Brain at a Regionwise and Network Level</td>
				<td>This paper studies age related changes in structural and functional organization of brain at all regions and at networks level. It characterizes SC-FC coupling and infers about the changes in age groups. This measure uniquely predicts age. Throughout subjects of different ages, the model captures many region-wise changes, but network-wise SC-FC relationships are yet to be discovered.</td>

				<td>Theoretical Neuroanatomy: Relating Anatomical and Functional Connectivity in Graphs and Cortical Connection Matrices</td>
				<td>This paper discusses about interpreting FC as covariance matrix of the neural activity. They assume that the neural activity that emerges can be described as a multidimensional stochastic process whose joint probability density function can be characterized by measures of entropy and mutual information. They selected among structurally varying graphs using as selective criteria a number of global information-theoretical measures that characterize functional connectivity (FC). They found that dynamics with high complaxity were supported by graphs whose units were sparsely and reciprocally interconnected. Further, they find a pettern in clusters; hierarchical subclusters and more clearly defined subdivisions.</td>

				<td>Complex brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional systems</td>
				<td>This paper is a review of graph theoretical study of brain. It discusses from scratch about formation of structural and functional graphs from multiple techniques - dMRI, fMRI, EEG, MEG, MEA. It then discusses some key organizational principles of graph properties as 'small-worldness', modularity, hubs & node centrality, etc. Further they discuss the importance of SC-FC matrices (corss-correlation or mutual information as edges) and their relationship through computational models. Finally, they suggest an applcation for the SC-FC relationship for network altering brain disorders.</td>

				<td>Structure and function of complex brain networks</td>
				<td>This paper provides an excellent comprehensve summary of the structural and functional brain networks; structural, functional and effective connectivity. <br> Structural networks are decomposed into modules (segregated view) and these modelues are interlined by very few strongly connected hubs (rich club and core). <br> Functional dynamics, initially thought as noise, was consistently forming topological patterns across humans and mammals and various trials. The recent hypothesis is that the task evoked activity shaped by anatomy is rehearsed by 'resting state networks' further strengthening the pathways according to Hebbian plasticity. <br> Finally, the paper discusses clinical applications and the position of connectomics in effort of understanding the brain.</td>
