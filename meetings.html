					<dt><b> Interpreting π's </b></dt>
					<dd>
						π's have almost full rank, i.e. if num_regions = 68, then rank is 67.
						<br> There are two views, but none has a strong support from cognition point of view.
						<ul>
							<li>A column of π can be interpreted as a pattern of co-activation of regions. Every column of π is an independent co-activation pattern. But this meaning as 'co-activations' has to be well understood.
							<br> (One link - modulation)</li>
							<li>According to Ashish Raj's paper, they call a column as initial configuaraion of regional activations. For jth column only region j is active. Hence, is this meaning is extended, jth column of π is a new representation of region j, but this representation is independent but not orthogonal!</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt><b>community detection</b></dt>
					<dd>before understanding π's well, to get some initial results, communities found at every scale can be studied. applied louvian community detection algorithm on FC_i, FC at each scale and found communities.</dd>
					<dt><b>Data collection for further projects</b></dt>
					<dd>1000 data samples need to be collected from Human Cnnectome Project</dd>
					<dt><b>Deadline for this paper submission</b>/dt>
					<dd>to boost up speed, it is tentative to finish up this paper by 2nd October, before Dussera holiday.</dd>

					<dt><b>Interpreting π's</b></dt>
					<dd>We are going with the interpretation as follows: 
						<ul>
							<li>Diffusion kernels capture correlations of BOLD signals between every pair of regions</li>
							<li>π at a scale, captures the modulation effect between all regions.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt><b>Linking MKL model with the differential equations</b></dt>
					<dd>Till now only MKL model's final form is giving results, but it needs to be linked to the differential equations which when solved take MKL form. For tihis, Ashish Raj's differential equation was taken forwrd, but mathematics needs to done properly yet (intuition anticipates a solution). Or need to come up with another explanation.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dt><b>Experiments</b></dt>
				<dd>
					Differential equation setting is independent of further analysis of π's. Hence,  
					<ul>
						<li>to see Pearson correlation between FC_{i} (= K_{i} * π_{i}) and FC_{emp} and SC_{emp}</li>
						<li>Compare π's for 68 and 188 regions whether similar regions are modulating in the both datasets.</li>

				<dt><b>Undestood how to interpret π's</b></dt>
				<dd>Plots of FC_{i} (= K_{i} π_{i}), K_{i}, π_{i} vs FC and SC were observed and an attemp to understand them was made. π's can be understood as inter-regional multi-scale coupling coefficients that mediate skewing coefficients to observe FC. </dd>

					to see that π's are consistent across

						<li>cross-validation folds</li>

						<li>across parcellations</li>

				</dd>
				<dt><b>diffusion multi-scales vs dynamic FC multi-scales</b></dt>
				<dd>Need to show that multiple time scales for forming dynamic FC are different than proposed diffusion time scales, with their applicability.</dd>
				<dt><b>try to find data</b></dt>
				<dd>the data should consist of around 500 SC-FC pairs, with fMRI time series, each for resting state, few tasks, and if possible some disease conditions. Along with it, data should also consist of meta-data like subject age.</dd>

				<dt>1. Comparing π's with higher parcellation data set. They visually look similar.</dt>
				<dt>1. Dynamic FC needs to be formed for experiments.</dt>
				<dt>3. For extracting data, data has been identified on the website. Pipeline for extracting SC matrix from DTi images is ready (to code). fMRI pipeline is yet to be identfied.</dt>

					Data needs to be verified as empirical FC's are not symmetric somehow!
					<br>
					list of results to be placed in order
					<ol>
						<li>simple pearson correlation comparison. Non-linear model yet to come.</li>
						<li>scatter plots for all models with proper lsline slope and R2 values.</li>
						<li>number of scales and random scale set experiment. How many scales to use and what all scale sets can be accomodated?</li>
						<li>
							Randomness experminet
							<ul>
								<li><u>Standard permutation test.</u> Predict FC from all models. Shuffle the prediced FC's and compute pearson correlation b/w these FC's and true FC. <br> <u>Implications</u>: this will statistically signify that our results are not generated by a random model.</li>
								<li><i>only for our model.</i> <br> keep π as it is, permute SC and test model on these random SC's. Plot histogram of the correlation w.r.t true FC. This histogram is centered around 0.35 correlation.<br> <u>Implications</u>: This will tell how much do the π's capture SC-FC relationship. Till now it is 0.35. Means with random SC but intact π's model is able to predict something.</li>
								<li><i>only for our model.</i><br> Keep SC intact and permute rows of π. Plot the same histogram as above. <br> <u>Implications</u>: This will tell how much π's contribute. These two expermients might be useful for thinking a meaning for π's. And may be possbile that different age-groups have different centers of histograms allowing a meaning of age-group specific residuals (hist centers).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Thresholding SC's. progressively threshod SC and compute thresholded FC and correlate with empirical FC. for all models.</li>
						<li>network summary statistics. from bct toolbox. 1. efficiency, 2. path length, 3. # communities, 4. cluster coefficient. <br> <i>requirement - not much</i></li>
						<li> Local to global scale specific FC's. scale specific community structure.</li>
						<li> <i>might have forgotten this in discussion</i> <br> the need to normalize scale choice across subjects. this is to ensure that same amount of heat is diffused between two nodes throught the subjects. <br> <u>Implications</u>: ...</li>
					</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><b>middle level agenda</b></dt>
				<dd>parallely think about what can the randominzing experiment tell us about π's.</dd>
				<dt><b>top level agenda</b></dt>
				<dd>to think about meaning of π simultaneously.</dd>
				<dt><i><u><b>deadline for these results</b></u></i></dt>
